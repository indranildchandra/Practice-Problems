Imran Tahir to Virat Kohli
INDIA WIN BY 9 WICKETS (with 177 balls left)! Their second best win in terms of balls remaining against a Test playing nation. A quicker full ball on middle, Kohli tries to power it over the leg side but it takes the inner half of his bat and screams past the diving backward square leg fielder. They take two runs and that will be it. The players shake hands in the middle and head back to the pavilion, again.

Chasing a low total can always be tricky. But not in this case. Rohit and Dhawan provided a quick start and once the former was dismissed, the Indian skipper joined his Delhi mate in the middle. Together, they went about the business quite professionally and never looked troubled. The current partnership worth 91 runs has completely shut down the doors on South Africa's chances, if at all there was any. Do join us after the break for the last rites.

India are cruising. The chase is almost done. They are only 2 runs away from going 2-0 up in the series. But all that will happen after a sumptuous lunch break. South Africa did manage to remove Rohit Sharma but after that the bowling was more or so flat. Their spinners failed to recreate what the Indian spinners managed to do and that actually reflects the large gap between the two teams. Tahir and Shamsi have been inconsistent with their lines and lengths, so the argument that the Indians are good players of spin doesn't really withstand. They have not bowled enough in testing areas and the current pair has flourished.

Short and outside off, Kohli goes back and cuts it through point for a couple of runs. Has the umpire called it lunch? Oh yes. What? Mike Haysman on air is not impressed, he voices his opinion that this is where common sense should prevail. Only 2 runs needed. Virat Kohli also has a chat with one of the umpires. But it seems they want to follow the rule blindly. Off they go, a really facepalm moment!

Acrobatic stuff by Tahir to save a certain boundary. Looked quite comical while doing so but did the job eventually. Back of a length delivery outside off, Kohli camps back and punches it square of the wicket on the off side. Tahir moves across to his left from sweeper cover, puts in an early dive probably but somehow manages to stop the ball just before the rope. Then, he struggles to pick up the ball, fumbles a bit before getting hold of the nut and then sends in the throw to the keeper. Two runs taken/saved.

OUT! Rohit holes out and gets a mild sendoff from Rabada. He bowls a sharp shortish ball on middle, angling in, Rohit tries to glance it off his hips but the bounce gets a bit big on him. It comes from the upper half of the bat and balloons down towards long leg. Morne Morkel speeds across to his left, slides and completes the catch with ease. That wasn't an easy catch but the tall man made it look so. India lose a wicket but stay on top in this game.

What's the use of the DRS if it's going to get it wrong like that? There needs to be CONCLUSIVE evidence to overturn a decision, if inconclusive it's umpires call. Come on @ICC  #SAvsIND @mmbangwa @MikeHaysman @NeilManthorp

Kagiso Rabada to Rohit Sharma
No edge. It's not South Africa's day. Rabada serves a full ball outside off, Rohit commits himself on the front foot and tries to push it through the line. He fails to middle it and it whizzes past the bat, making some sound. Quinton de Kock catches it, he doesn't appeal much (didn't feel the need as he was sure of the edge), but the rest are screaming their lungs out. Up goes the finger and Sharma is quick to take the DRS. The replays roll on and it's a close call. The bat and pad are very close to each other when the ball goes past the former. Is the sound of the bat hitting the pad? The Snicko is showing good deflection but again no one is sure it's off what? The third umpire however feels the replays are conclusive enough to change the onfield ruling. He assumes it's bat hitting the pad and not the ball. Rohit survives.
Huge shout for a caught behind. The finger goes up and Rohit Sharma takes the referral.

Morkel goes for the magical ball, sends across a yorker on off, Rohit has played enough cricket to anticipate that. He reaches out for it and digs it out to covers.

SIX! Out of here, deep into the stand at mid-wicket. Morkel digs in a short ball and Rohit is quick to drops his weight on the back foot. Lovely transfer of weight and it's followed by a superb bat speed to execute the pull shot. Makes fine connection and sends it whistling into the crowd. He is one of the best Indian batsmen when it comes to pulling or hooking.
