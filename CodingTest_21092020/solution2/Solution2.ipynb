      "Commentary: No edge. It's not South Africa's day. Rabada serves a full ball outside off, Rohit commits himself on the front foot and tries to push it through the line. He fails to middle it and it whizzes past the bat, making some sound. Quinton de Kock catches it, he doesn't appeal much (didn't feel the need as he was sure of the edge), but the rest are screaming their lungs out. Up goes the finger and Sharma is quick to take the DRS. The replays roll on and it's a close call. The bat and pad are very close to each other when the ball goes past the former. Is the sound of the bat hitting the pad? The Snicko is showing good deflection but again no one is sure it's off what? The third umpire however feels the replays are conclusive enough to change the onfield ruling. He assumes it's bat hitting the pad and not the ball. Rohit survives.\n",
