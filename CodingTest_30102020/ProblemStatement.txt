Design push and pull APIs for a producer consumer system with N producers and M consumers conforming to the following definitions:

Push(Key, Payload);
Push need not have consecutive keys. But keys pushed are monotonically increasing.

Payload Pull(Key);
Pull can be for any seq/key number.
If the seq number is not found, return the payload for the immediate next higher sequence number.
If there is no next higher seq num, return null.

Container has a fixed amount of memory. 
When the container is full, you can delete the lowest sequence number.
Once an item is pulled, it is unavailable for other pulls and can be discarded by the container

capacity = 3
push (1, "value1")

push (3, "value3")

push (5, "value5")

pull (2) => "value3"

push (10, "value10") 

push (15, "value15")  => deletion of (1, "value")
