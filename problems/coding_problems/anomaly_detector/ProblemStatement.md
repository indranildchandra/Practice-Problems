# Real-Time Anomaly Detector for Sensor Data

Imagine you’re building a real-time anomaly detector for a stream of sensor data, such as temperature readings. Your goal is to detect if the average of the last 'N' readings exceeds a certain threshold. Design a system that can handle this task efficiently, processing millions of events per second.
